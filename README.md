# Enigmata
A game for people that like to solve mazes.

Solve the Enigmata mazes while finding cubes and placing them in the color-coded pool for additional points. One player walks the maze in VR or First Person mode, or test your communication skills with an unlimited number of onlookers acting as navigators with an overhead map-like view of the maze. 
 
Enigmata is a game that features ProcGen mazes of varying degrees of complexity that the player can solve. Enigmata is inspired by escape rooms, hedge mazes, old issues of Games Magazine, and my childhood love of Highlights.

# VR Couch Co-Op Multiplayer
Enigmata uses an unusual form of asymmetrical multiplayer. While one person walks through the maze, an unlimited number of observers and navigators can view a map of the maze, giving instruction and navigation in voice or chat. The games are not hosted or connected, so no network connectivity is required -- just the map code and a means to communicate with each other, like skype or discord or jitsi. 

# FAQ
### How does couch co-op work?
One person is in the maze in VR (or first person desktop mode!). Friends in the same room can use your map code to see an overhead map of the maze. Talking with each other, the person in the maze can figure out where they are and where to go.

### Can I play online?
Just like couch co-op, but instead of being in the same room, they can use your map code remotely. Stay in discord or skype together to share directions and ideas!

### Twitch?
Yep. Every single person in your twitch chat can use your map code. There's no inter-connectivity needed for orienteering. Chat with your navigators in stream chat.

### How do I view a map?
To use a map code, enter the map code in the text box on the title screen and then click "NAVIGATE". A duplicate of the maze will be generated and you'll have a birds eye view of the maze. Now, you just have to talk to the person walking the maze to figure out where they are!

### Is it cross platform?
Yes! There is no inter-connectivity for the game modes, so you can play it on whatever you like, with whoever you like. Right now, I am only making builds for Windows and Linux. SteamVR is no longer supporting macOS.

# Install
Enigmata is not yet ready for that kind of thing, but if you're feeling frosty, you can build it from source by cloning or downloading this git repository. You're absolutely welcome to do so.


# Building and Tools
Enigmata is created in Godot 3.4.2. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a FOSS game engine and you can get it from itch.io, steam, or their website. 

If you're building for Windows, you might need to follow the instructions for installing [rcedit-x64](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/changing_application_icon_for_windows.html) to get the build application icons to work properly. That isn't required though.
