# Enigmata
A game for people that like to solve mazes.
 
Enigmata is a game that features ProcGen mazes of varying degrees of complexity that the player can solve. Enigmata is inspired by escape rooms, hedge mazes, old issues of Games Magazine, and my childhood love of Highlights.


# Install
Enigmata is not yet ready for that kind of thing, but if you're feeling frosty, you can build it from source by cloning or downloading this git repository. You're absolutely welcome to do so.


# Building and Tools
Enigmata is created in Godot 3.4. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a FOSS game engine and you can get it from itch.io, steam, or their website. 

If you're building for Windows, you might need to follow the instructions for installing [rcedit-x64](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/changing_application_icon_for_windows.html) to get the build application icons to work properly. That isn't required though.
